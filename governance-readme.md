# Re3istry governance

The governance structure and processes of the Re3gistry aim to ensure the use and sustainability of the re3gistry by the Community, and to keep it aligned to the Community's needs.

The governance is ensured through the managers of the system.

## Project boards

* Re3gistry Improvement proposal (R3IPs)
    * If you would like to discuss an idea before documenting a full R3IP, simply create a new issue using the [R3IP template](https://github.com/ec-jrc/re3gistry/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=re3gistry-improvement-proposal.md). Complete the template as far as possible and mention that this is not a complete proposal yet, but that you are looking for feedback. If the idea is supported, you will be asked you to complete the proposal.
   
* Bug fixing
    * If you would like to submit a bug report, please create a new issue in the Re3gistry repository using the [Bug report template](https://github.com/ec-jrc/re3gistry/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=re3gistry-problem.md). The issue will be monitored and will be added to the bugfixing project board. If additional information is required, you will be contacted.
    * The project board will be updated whenever the status of an issue changes.
    * Pull requests for bugfixes are very welcome (see "Contributing" below)!
