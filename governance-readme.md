# Re3istry governance

The governance structure and processes of the Re3gistry aim to ensure the use and sustainability of the re3gistry by the Community, and to keep the it aligned to the Community's needs.

The governance is ensured through the managers of the system.

## Project boards

* Re3gistry Improvement proposal (R3IPs)
    * If you would like to discuss an idea before documenting a full R3IP, simply create a new issue using the [Re3IP template](https://github.com/ec-jrc/re3gistry/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=re3gistry-improvement-proposal.md). Complete the template as far as possible and mention that this is not a complete proposal yet, but that you are looking for feedback. If the managers supports it, it will change the tag to "Proposer: draft/refine R3IP" and ask you to complete the proposal.
    * Once an R3IP is ready for approval. If the draft needs further updates, it will be moved back to "Proposer: draft/refine EIP" until all open questions are resolved.
* Bug fixing
    * If you would like to submit a bug report, please create a new issue in the Re3gistry repository using the [Bug report template](https://github.com/ec-jrc/re3gistry/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=re3gistry-problem.md). The managers members monitor the issues and will add them to bugfixing project board. If additional information is required, you will be contacted.
    * The managers will update the project board whenever the status of an issue changes.
    * Pull requests for bugfixes are very welcome (see "Contributing" below)!
